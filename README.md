# PROJECT: INTERACTIVE ENGLISH DICTIONARY

This is an English dictionary program made using Python. This program is meant to accept a word from a user and returns the various definitions of the word.

If a user gives an incorrectly spelt word, the program will confirm with the user by giving them a word that closely matches the input and return the definition, otherwise it will inform the user the word does not exist.

Modules used: **[json, difflib]**
